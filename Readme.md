# chocolatey-appstore theme as chrome extension

  Changes all package install textboxes to installation buttons on chocolatey.org/packages and utilizes bcurran3's protocol handler.

  I created this extension, because there was no protocoll support
  on the chocolatey homepage - and chocolatey-gui fustratingly slow.

  While at it, I changed the style of the app listing to suit my
  taste.

## Installation

1. get the extension from [google chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
2. install chocolatey from [chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/install)
3. open the [packages page](https://chocolatey.org/packages) - there is an info box at the top, explaining the rest.
